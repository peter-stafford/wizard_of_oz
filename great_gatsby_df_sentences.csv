2,1,"""\u201cWhenever you feel like criticizing anyone,\u201d he told me, \u201cjust remember that all the people in this world haven\u2019t had the advantages that you\u2019ve had.\u201d"""
3,1,"""He didn\u2019t say any more, but we\u2019ve always been unusually communicative in a reserved way, and I understood that he meant a great deal more than that."""
4,1,"""In consequence, I\u2019m inclined to reserve all judgements, a habit that has opened up many curious natures to me and also made me the victim of not a few veteran bores."""
5,1,"""The abnormal mind is quick to detect and attach itself to this quality when it appears in a normal person, and so it came about that in college I was unjustly accused of being a politician, because I was privy to the secret griefs of wild, unknown men."""
6,1,"""Most of the confidences were unsought\u2014frequently I have feigned sleep, preoccupation, or a hostile levity when I realized by some unmistakable sign that an intimate revelation was quivering on the horizon; for the intimate revelations of young men, or at least the terms in which they express them, are usually plagiaristic and marred by obvious suppressions."""
7,1,"""Reserving judgements is a matter of infinite hope."""
8,1,"""I am still a little afraid of missing something if I forget that, as my father snobbishly suggested, and I snobbishly repeat, a sense of the fundamental decencies is parcelled out unequally at birth."""
9,1,"""And, after boasting this way of my tolerance, I come to the admission that it has a limit."""
10,1,"""Conduct may be founded on the hard rock or the wet marshes, but after a certain point I don\u2019t care what it\u2019s founded on."""

13,1,"""If personality is an unbroken series of successful gestures, then there was something gorgeous about him, some heightened sensitivity to the promises of life, as if he were related to one of those intricate machines that register earthquakes ten thousand miles away."""
14,1,"""This responsiveness had nothing to do with that flabby impressionability which is dignified under the name of the \u201ccreative temperament\u201d\u2014it was an extraordinary gift for hope, a romantic readiness such as I have never found in any other person and which it is not likely I shall ever find again."""
15,1,"""No\u2014Gatsby turned out all right at the end; it is what preyed on Gatsby, what foul dust floated in the wake of his dreams that temporarily closed out my interest in the abortive sorrows and short-winded elations of men."""
16,1,"""------------------------------------------------------------------------"""
17,1,"""My family have been prominent, well-to-do people in this Middle Western city for three generations."""
18,1,"""The Carraways are something of a clan, and we have a tradition that we\u2019re descended from the Dukes of Buccleuch, but the actual founder of my line was my grandfather\u2019s brother, who came here in fifty-one, sent a substitute to the Civil War, and started the wholesale hardware business that my father carries on today."""
19,1,"""I never saw this great-uncle, but I\u2019m supposed to look like him\u2014with special reference to the rather hard-boiled painting that hangs in father\u2019s office."""

21,1,"""I enjoyed the counter-raid so thoroughly that I came back restless."""
22,1,"""Instead of being the warm centre of the world, the Middle West now seemed like the ragged edge of the universe\u2014so I decided to go East and learn the bond business."""
23,1,"""Everybody I knew was in the bond business, so I supposed it could support one more single man."""
24,1,"""All my aunts and uncles talked it over as if they were choosing a prep school for me, and finally said, \u201cWhy\u2014ye-es,\u201d with very grave, hesitant faces."""
25,1,"""Father agreed to finance me for a year, and after various delays I came East, permanently, I thought, in the spring of twenty-two."""
26,1,"""The practical thing was to find rooms in the city, but it was a warm season, and I had just left a country of wide lawns and friendly trees, so when a young man at the office suggested that we take a house together in a commuting town, it sounded like a great idea."""
27,1,"""He found the house, a weather-beaten cardboard bungalow at eighty a month, but at the last minute the firm ordered him to Washington, and I went out to the country alone."""
28,1,"""I had a dog\u2014at least I had him for a few days until he ran away\u2014and an old Dodge and a Finnish woman, who made my bed and cooked breakfast and muttered Finnish wisdom to herself over the electric stove."""

30,1,"""\u201cHow do you get to West Egg village?\u201d"""
31,1,"""he asked helplessly."""
32,1,"""I told him."""
33,1,"""And as I walked on I was lonely no longer."""
34,1,"""I was a guide, a pathfinder, an original settler."""
35,1,"""He had casually conferred on me the freedom of the neighbourhood."""
36,1,"""And so with the sunshine and the great bursts of leaves growing on the trees, just as things grow in fast movies, I had that familiar conviction that life was beginning over again with the summer."""
37,1,"""There was so much to read, for one thing, and so much fine health to be pulled down out of the young breath-giving air."""
38,1,"""I bought a dozen volumes on banking and credit and investment securities, and they stood on my shelf in red and gold like new money from the mint, promising to unfold the shining secrets that only Midas and Morgan and Maecenas knew."""
39,1,"""And I had the high intention of reading many other books besides."""
40,1,"""I was rather literary in college\u2014one year I wrote a series of very solemn and obvious editorials for the Yale News\u2014and now I was going to bring back all such things into my life and become again that most limited of all specialists, the \u201cwell-rounded man.\u201d"""

44,1,"""Twenty miles from the city a pair of enormous eggs, identical in contour and separated only by a courtesy bay, jut out into the most domesticated body of salt water in the Western hemisphere, the great wet barnyard of Long Island Sound."""
45,1,"""They are not perfect ovals\u2014like the egg in the Columbus story, they are both crushed flat at the contact end\u2014but their physical resemblance must be a source of perpetual wonder to the gulls that fly overhead."""
46,1,"""To the wingless a more interesting phenomenon is their dissimilarity in every particular except shape and size."""
47,1,"""I lived at West Egg, the\u2014well, the less fashionable of the two, though this is a most superficial tag to express the bizarre and not a little sinister contrast between them."""
48,1,"""My house was at the very tip of the egg, only fifty yards from the Sound, and squeezed between two huge places that rented for twelve or fifteen thousand a season."""
49,1,"""The one on my right was a colossal affair by any standard\u2014it was a factual imitation of some H\u00f4tel de Ville in Normandy, with a tower on one side, spanking new under a thin beard of raw ivy, and a marble swimming pool, and more than forty acres of lawn and garden."""
50,1,"""It was Gatsby\u2019s mansion."""
51,1,"""Or, rather, as I didn\u2019t know Mr. Gatsby, it was a mansion inhabited by a gentleman of that name."""
52,1,"""My own house was an eyesore, but it was a small eyesore, and it had been overlooked, so I had a view of the water, a partial view of my neighbour\u2019s lawn, and the consoling proximity of millionaires\u2014all for eighty dollars a month."""
53,1,"""Across the courtesy bay the white palaces of fashionable East Egg glittered along the water, and the history of the summer really begins on the evening I drove over there to have dinner with the Tom Buchanans."""

55,1,"""And just after the war I spent two days with them in Chicago."""
56,1,"""Her husband, among various physical accomplishments, had been one of the most powerful ends that ever played football at New Haven\u2014a national figure in a way, one of those men who reach such an acute limited excellence at twenty-one that everything afterward savours of anticlimax."""
57,1,"""His family were enormously wealthy\u2014even in college his freedom with money was a matter for reproach\u2014but now he\u2019d left Chicago and come East in a fashion that rather took your breath away: for instance, he\u2019d brought down a string of polo ponies from Lake Forest."""
58,1,"""It was hard to realize that a man in my own generation was wealthy enough to do that."""
59,1,"""Why they came East"""
60,1,"""I don\u2019t know."""
61,1,"""They had spent a year in France for no particular reason, and then drifted here and there unrestfully wherever people played polo and were rich together."""
62,1,"""This was a permanent move, said Daisy over the telephone, but I didn\u2019t believe it\u2014"""
63,1,"""I had no sight into Daisy\u2019s heart, but I felt that Tom would drift on forever seeking, a little wistfully, for the dramatic turbulence of some irrecoverable football game."""
64,1,"""And so it happened that on a warm windy evening I drove over to East Egg to see two old friends whom I scarcely knew at all."""
65,1,"""Their house was even more elaborate than I expected, a cheerful red-and-white Georgian Colonial mansion, overlooking the bay."""
66,1,"""The lawn started at the beach and ran towards the front door for a quarter of a mile, jumping over sundials and brick walks and burning gardens\u2014finally when it reached the house drifting up the side in bright vines as though from the momentum of its run."""
67,1,"""The front was broken by a line of French windows, glowing now with reflected gold and wide open to the warm windy afternoon, and Tom Buchanan in riding clothes was standing with his legs apart on the front porch."""
68,1,"""He had changed since his New Haven years."""
69,1,"""Now he was a sturdy straw-haired man of thirty, with a rather hard mouth and a supercilious manner."""
70,1,"""Two shining arrogant eyes had established dominance over his face and gave him the appearance of always leaning aggressively forward."""
71,1,"""Not even the effeminate swank of his riding clothes could hide the enormous power of that body\u2014he seemed to fill those glistening boots until he strained the top lacing, and you could see a great pack of muscle shifting when his shoulder moved under his thin coat."""
72,1,"""It was a body capable of enormous leverage\u2014a cruel body."""
73,1,"""His speaking voice, a gruff husky tenor, added to the impression of fractiousness he conveyed."""
74,1,"""There was a touch of paternal contempt in it, even toward people he liked\u2014and there were men at New Haven who had hated his guts."""
75,1,"""\u201cNow, don\u2019t think my opinion on these matters is final,\u201d he seemed to say, \u201cjust because I\u2019m stronger and more of a man than you are.\u201d"""
76,1,"""We were in the same senior society, and while we were never intimate I always had the impression that he approved of me and wanted me to like him with some harsh, defiant wistfulness of his own."""
77,1,"""We talked for a few minutes on the sunny porch."""
78,1,"""\u201cI\u2019ve got a nice place here,\u201d he said, his eyes flashing about restlessly."""
79,1,"""Turning me around by one arm, he moved a broad flat hand along the front vista, including in its sweep a sunken Italian garden, a half acre of deep, pungent roses, and a snub-nosed motorboat that bumped the tide offshore."""
80,1,"""\u201cIt belonged to Demaine, the oil man.\u201d"""
81,1,"""He turned me around again, politely and abruptly."""
82,1,"""\u201cWe\u2019ll go inside.\u201d"""
83,1,"""We walked through a high hallway into a bright rosy-coloured space, fragilely bound into the house by French windows at either end."""
84,1,"""The windows were ajar and gleaming white against the fresh grass outside that seemed to grow a little way into the house."""
85,1,"""A breeze blew through the room, blew curtains in at one end and out the other like pale flags, twisting them up toward the frosted wedding-cake of the ceiling, and then rippled over the wine-coloured rug, making a shadow on it as wind does on the sea."""
86,1,"""The only completely stationary object in the room was an enormous couch on which two young women were buoyed up as though upon an anchored balloon."""
87,1,"""They were both in white, and their dresses were rippling and fluttering as if they had just been blown back in after a short flight around the house."""
88,1,"""I must have stood for a few moments listening to the whip and snap of the curtains and the groan of a picture on the wall."""
89,1,"""Then there was a boom as Tom Buchanan shut the rear windows and the caught wind died out about the room, and the curtains and the rugs and the two young women ballooned slowly to the floor."""
90,1,"""The younger of the two was a stranger to me."""
91,1,"""She was extended full length at her end of the divan, completely motionless, and with her chin raised a little, as if she were balancing something on it which was quite likely to fall."""
92,1,"""If she saw me out of the corner of her eyes she gave no hint of it\u2014indeed, I was almost surprised into murmuring an apology for having disturbed her by coming in."""
93,1,"""The other girl, Daisy, made an attempt to rise\u2014she leaned slightly forward with a conscientious expression\u2014then she laughed, an absurd, charming little laugh, and I laughed too and came forward into the room."""
94,1,"""\u201cI\u2019m p-paralysed with happiness.\u201d"""
95,1,"""She laughed again, as if she said something very witty, and held my hand for a moment, looking up into my face, promising that there was no one in the world she so much wanted to see."""
96,1,"""That was a way she had."""
97,1,"""She hinted in a murmur that the surname of the balancing girl was Baker."""
98,1,"""(I\u2019ve heard it said that Daisy\u2019s murmur was only to make people lean toward her; an irrelevant criticism that made it no less charming.)"""
99,1,"""At any rate, Miss Baker\u2019s lips fluttered, she nodded at me almost imperceptibly, and then quickly tipped her head back again\u2014the object she was balancing had obviously tottered a little and given her something of a fright."""
100,1,"""Again a sort of apology arose to my lips."""
101,1,"""Almost any exhibition of complete self-sufficiency draws a stunned tribute from me."""
102,1,"""I looked back at my cousin, who began to ask me questions in her low, thrilling voice."""
103,1,"""It was the kind of voice that the ear follows up and down, as if each speech is an arrangement of notes that will never be played again."""
104,1,"""Her face was sad and lovely with bright things in it, bright eyes and a bright passionate mouth, but there was an excitement in her voice that men who had cared for her found difficult to forget: a singing compulsion, a whispered \u201cListen,\u201d a promise that she had done gay, exciting things just a while since and that there were gay, exciting things hovering in the next hour."""
105,1,"""I told her how I had stopped off in Chicago for a day on my way East, and how a dozen people had sent their love through me."""
106,1,"""\u201cDo they miss me?\u201d"""
107,1,"""she cried ecstatically."""
108,1,"""\u201cThe whole town is desolate."""
109,1,"""All the cars have the left rear wheel painted black as a mourning wreath, and there\u2019s a persistent wail all night along the north shore.\u201d"""
110,1,"""\u201cHow gorgeous!"""
111,1,"""Let\u2019s go back, Tom."""
112,1,"""Tomorrow!\u201d"""
113,1,"""Then she added irrelevantly: \u201cYou ought to see the baby.\u201d"""
114,1,"""\u201cI\u2019d like to.\u201d"""
115,1,"""\u201cShe\u2019s asleep."""
116,1,"""She\u2019s three years old."""
117,1,"""Haven\u2019t you ever seen her?\u201d"""
118,1,"""\u201cNever.\u201d"""
119,1,"""\u201cWell, you ought to see her."""
120,1,"""She\u2019s\u2014\u201d Tom Buchanan, who had been hovering restlessly about the room, stopped and rested his hand on my shoulder."""
121,1,"""\u201cWhat you doing, Nick?\u201d"""
122,1,"""\u201cI\u2019m a bond man.\u201d"""
123,1,"""\u201cWho with?\u201d"""
124,1,"""I told him."""
125,1,"""\u201cNever heard of them,\u201d he remarked decisively."""
126,1,"""This annoyed me."""
127,1,"""\u201cYou will,\u201d I answered shortly."""
128,1,"""\u201cYou will if you stay in the East.\u201d"""
129,1,"""\u201cOh, I\u2019ll stay in the East, don\u2019t you worry,\u201d he said, glancing at Daisy and then back at me, as if he were alert for something more."""
130,1,"""\u201cI\u2019d be a God damned fool to live anywhere else.\u201d"""
131,1,"""At this point Miss Baker said: \u201cAbsolutely!\u201d"""
132,1,"""with such suddenness that I started\u2014it was the first word she had uttered since I came into the room."""
133,1,"""Evidently it surprised her as much as it did me, for she yawned and with a series of rapid, deft movements stood up into the room."""
134,1,"""\u201cI\u2019m stiff,\u201d she complained, \u201cI\u2019ve been lying on that sofa for as long as I can remember.\u201d"""
135,1,"""\u201cDon\u2019t look at me,\u201d Daisy retorted, \u201cI\u2019ve been trying to get you to New York all afternoon.\u201d"""
136,1,"""\u201cNo, thanks,\u201d said Miss Baker to the four cocktails just in from the pantry."""
137,1,"""\u201cI\u2019m absolutely in training.\u201d"""
138,1,"""Her host looked at her incredulously."""
139,1,"""\u201cYou are!\u201d"""
140,1,"""He took down his drink as if it were a drop in the bottom of a glass."""
141,1,"""\u201cHow you ever get anything done is beyond me.\u201d"""
142,1,"""I looked at Miss Baker, wondering what it was she \u201cgot done.\u201d"""
143,1,"""I enjoyed looking at her."""
144,1,"""She was a slender, small-breasted girl, with an erect carriage, which she accentuated by throwing her body backward at the shoulders like a young cadet."""
145,1,"""Her grey sun-strained eyes looked back at me with polite reciprocal curiosity out of a wan, charming, discontented face."""
146,1,"""It occurred to me now that I had seen her, or a picture of her, somewhere before."""
147,1,"""\u201cYou live in West Egg,\u201d she remarked contemptuously."""
148,1,"""\u201cI know somebody there.\u201d"""
149,1,"""\u201cI don\u2019t know a single\u2014\u201d \u201cYou must know Gatsby.\u201d"""
150,1,"""\u201cGatsby?\u201d demanded Daisy."""
151,1,"""\u201cWhat Gatsby?\u201d"""
152,1,"""Before I could reply that he was my neighbour dinner was announced; wedging his tense arm imperatively under mine, Tom Buchanan compelled me from the room as though he were moving a checker to another square."""
153,1,"""Slenderly, languidly, their hands set lightly on their hips, the two young women preceded us out on to a rosy-coloured porch, open toward the sunset, where four candles flickered on the table in the diminished wind."""
154,1,"""\u201cWhy candles?\u201d objected Daisy, frowning."""
155,1,"""She snapped them out with her fingers."""
156,1,"""\u201cIn two weeks it\u2019ll be the longest day in the year.\u201d"""
157,1,"""She looked at us all radiantly."""
158,1,"""\u201cDo you always watch for the longest day of the year and then miss it?"""
159,1,"""I always watch for the longest day in the year and then miss it.\u201d"""
160,1,"""\u201cWe ought to plan something,\u201d yawned Miss Baker, sitting down at the table as if she were getting into bed."""
161,1,"""\u201cAll right,\u201d said Daisy."""
162,1,"""\u201cWhat\u2019ll we plan?\u201d"""
163,1,"""She turned to me helplessly: \u201cWhat do people plan?\u201d"""
164,1,"""Before I could answer her eyes fastened with an awed expression on her little finger."""
165,1,"""\u201cLook!\u201d"""
166,1,"""she complained; \u201cI hurt it.\u201d"""
167,1,"""We all looked\u2014the knuckle was black and blue."""
168,1,"""\u201cYou did it, Tom,\u201d she said accusingly."""
169,1,"""\u201cI know you didn\u2019t mean to, but you did do it."""
170,1,"""That\u2019s what I get for marrying a brute of a man, a great, big, hulking physical specimen of a\u2014\u201d \u201cI hate that word \u2018hulking,\u2019\u200a\u201d objected Tom crossly, \u201ceven in kidding.\u201d"""
171,1,"""\u201cHulking,\u201d insisted Daisy."""
172,1,"""Sometimes she and Miss Baker talked at once, unobtrusively and with a bantering inconsequence that was never quite chatter, that was as cool as their white dresses and their impersonal eyes in the absence of all desire."""
173,1,"""They were here, and they accepted Tom and me, making only a polite pleasant effort to entertain or to be entertained."""
174,1,"""They knew that presently dinner would be over and a little later the evening too would be over and casually put away."""
175,1,"""It was sharply different from the West, where an evening was hurried from phase to phase towards its close, in a continually disappointed anticipation or else in sheer nervous dread of the moment itself."""
176,1,"""\u201cYou make me feel uncivilized, Daisy,\u201d I confessed on my second glass of corky but rather impressive claret."""
177,1,"""\u201cCan\u2019t you talk about crops or something?\u201d"""
178,1,"""I meant nothing in particular by this remark, but it was taken up in an unexpected way."""
179,1,"""\u201cCivilization\u2019s going to pieces,\u201d broke out Tom violently."""
180,1,"""\u201cI\u2019ve gotten to be a terrible pessimist about things."""
181,1,"""Have you read The Rise of the Coloured Empires by this man Goddard?\u201d"""
182,1,"""\u201cWhy, no,\u201d I answered, rather surprised by his tone."""
183,1,"""\u201cWell, it\u2019s a fine book, and everybody ought to read it."""
184,1,"""The idea is if we don\u2019t look out the white race will be\u2014will be utterly submerged."""
185,1,"""It\u2019s all scientific stuff; it\u2019s been proved.\u201d"""
186,1,"""\u201cTom\u2019s getting very profound,\u201d said Daisy, with an expression of unthoughtful sadness."""
187,1,"""\u201cHe reads deep books with long words in them."""
188,1,"""What was that word we\u2014\u201d \u201cWell, these books are all scientific,\u201d insisted Tom, glancing at her impatiently."""
189,1,"""\u201cThis fellow has worked out the whole thing."""
190,1,"""It\u2019s up to us, who are the dominant race, to watch out or these other races will have control of things.\u201d"""
191,1,"""\u201cWe\u2019ve got to beat them down,\u201d whispered Daisy, winking ferociously toward the fervent sun."""
192,1,"""\u201cYou ought to live in California\u2014\u201d began Miss Baker, but Tom interrupted her by shifting heavily in his chair."""
193,1,"""\u201cThis idea is that we\u2019re Nordics."""
194,1,"""I am, and you are, and you are, and\u2014\u201d"""
195,1,"""After an infinitesimal hesitation he included Daisy with a slight nod, and she winked at me again."""
196,1,"""\u201c\u2014And we\u2019ve produced all the things that go to make civilization\u2014oh, science and art, and all that."""
197,1,"""Do you see?\u201d"""
198,1,"""There was something pathetic in his concentration, as if his complacency, more acute than of old, was not enough to him any more."""
199,1,"""When, almost immediately, the telephone rang inside and the butler left the porch Daisy seized upon the momentary interruption and leaned towards me."""
200,1,"""\u201cI\u2019ll tell you a family secret,\u201d she whispered enthusiastically."""
201,1,"""\u201cIt\u2019s about the butler\u2019s nose."""
202,1,"""Do you want to hear about the butler\u2019s nose?\u201d"""
203,1,"""\u201cThat\u2019s why I came over tonight.\u201d"""
204,1,"""\u201cWell, he wasn\u2019t always a butler; he used to be the silver polisher for some people in New York that had a silver service for two hundred people."""

662,3,"""Laughter is easier minute by minute, spilled with prodigality, tipped out at a cheerful word."""
663,3,"""The groups change more swiftly, swell with new arrivals, dissolve and form in the same breath; already there are wanderers, confident girls who weave here and there among the stouter and more stable, become for a sharp, joyous moment the centre of a group, and then, excited with triumph, glide on through the sea-change of faces and voices and colour under the constantly changing light."""
664,3,"""Suddenly one of these gypsies, in trembling opal, seizes a cocktail out of the air, dumps it down for courage and, moving her hands like Frisco, dances out alone on the canvas platform."""

672,3,"""I had been actually invited."""
673,3,"""A chauffeur in a uniform of robin\u2019s-egg blue crossed my lawn early that Saturday morning with a surprisingly formal note from his employer: the honour would be entirely Gatsby\u2019s, it said, if I would attend his \u201clittle party\u201d that night."""

676,3,"""I was immediately struck by the number of young Englishmen dotted about; all well dressed, all looking a little hungry, and all talking in low, earnest voices to solid and prosperous Americans."""
677,3,"""I was sure that they were selling something: bonds or insurance or automobiles."""

679,3,"""As soon as I arrived I made an attempt to find my host, but the two or three people of whom I asked his whereabouts stared at me in such an amazed way, and denied so vehemently any knowledge of his movements, that I slunk off in the direction of the cocktail table\u2014the only place in the garden where a single man could linger without looking purposeless and alone."""
680,3,"""I was on my way to get roaring drunk from sheer embarrassment when Jordan Baker came out of the house and stood at the head of the marble steps, leaning a little backward and looking with contemptuous interest down into the garden."""

693,3,"""\u201cYou\u2019ve dyed your hair since then,\u201d remarked Jordan, and I started, but the girls had moved casually on and her remark was addressed to the premature moon, produced like the supper, no doubt, out of a caterer\u2019s basket."""
694,3,"""With Jordan\u2019s slender golden arm resting in mine, we descended the steps and sauntered about the garden."""
695,3,"""A tray of cocktails floated at us through the twilight, and we sat down at a table with the two girls in yellow and three men, each one introduced to us as Mr. Mumble."""

717,3,"""\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s so much that,\u201d argued Lucille sceptically; \u201cIt\u2019s more that he was a German spy during the war.\u201d"""
718,3,"""One of the men nodded in confirmation."""

732,3,"""We got up, and she explained that we were going to find the host: I had never met him, she said, and it was making me uneasy."""
733,3,"""The undergraduate nodded in a cynical, melancholy way."""
734,3,"""The bar, where we glanced first, was crowded, but Gatsby was not there."""
735,3,"""She couldn\u2019t find him from the top of the steps, and he wasn\u2019t on the veranda."""
736,3,"""On a chance we tried an important-looking door, and walked into a high Gothic library, panelled with carved English oak, and probably transported complete from some ruin overseas."""
737,3,"""A stout, middle-aged man, with enormous owl-eyed spectacles, was sitting somewhat drunk on the edge of a great table, staring with unsteady concentration at the shelves of books."""

785,3,"""We shook hands with him gravely and went back outdoors."""
786,3,"""There was dancing now on the canvas in the garden; old men pushing young girls backward in eternal graceless circles, superior couples holding each other tortuously, fashionably, and keeping in the corners\u2014and a great number of single girls dancing individually or relieving the orchestra for a moment of the burden of the banjo or the traps."""
787,3,"""By midnight the hilarity had increased."""
788,3,"""A celebrated tenor had sung in Italian, and a notorious contralto had sung in jazz, and between the numbers people were doing \u201cstunts\u201d all over the garden, while happy, vacuous bursts of laughter rose toward the summer sky."""

790,3,"""The moon had risen higher, and floating in the Sound was a triangle of silver scales, trembling a little to the stiff, tinny drip of the banjoes on the lawn."""
791,3,"""I was still with Jordan Baker."""
792,3,"""We were sitting at a table with a man of about my age and a rowdy little girl, who gave way upon the slightest provocation to uncontrollable laughter."""

2795,8,"""There was a ripe mystery about it, a hint of bedrooms upstairs more beautiful and cool than other bedrooms, of gay and radiant activities taking place through its corridors, and of romances that were not musty and laid away already in lavender but fresh and breathing and redolent of this year\u2019s shining motorcars and of dances whose flowers were scarcely withered."""
2796,8,"""It excited him, too, that many men had already loved Daisy\u2014it increased her value in his eyes."""

2803,8,"""I don\u2019t mean that he had traded on his phantom millions, but he had deliberately given Daisy a sense of security; he let her believe that he was a person from much the same strata as herself\u2014that he was fully able to take care of her."""
2804,8,"""As a matter of fact, he had no such facilities\u2014he had no comfortable family standing behind him, and he was liable at the whim of an impersonal government to be blown anywhere about the world."""

2810,8,"""When they met again, two days later, it was Gatsby who was breathless, who was, somehow, betrayed."""
2811,8,"""Her porch was bright with the bought luxury of star-shine; the wicker of the settee squeaked fashionably as she turned toward him and he kissed her curious and lovely mouth."""
2812,8,"""She had caught a cold, and it made her voice huskier and more charming than ever, and Gatsby was overwhelmingly aware of the youth and mystery that wealth imprisons and preserves, of the freshness of many clothes, and of Daisy, gleaming like silver, safe and proud above the hot struggles of the poor."""

2823,8,"""They had never been closer in their month of love, nor communicated more profoundly one with another, than when she brushed silent lips against his coat\u2019s shoulder or when he touched the end of her fingers, gently, as though she were asleep."""

2825,8,"""He did extraordinarily well in the war."""

2828,8,"""He was worried now\u2014there was a quality of nervous despair in Daisy\u2019s letters."""
2829,8,"""She didn\u2019t see why he couldn\u2019t come."""
2830,8,"""She was feeling the pressure of the world outside, and she wanted to see him and feel his presence beside her and be reassured that she was doing the right thing after all."""
2831,8,"""For Daisy was young and her artificial world was redolent of orchids and pleasant, cheerful snobbery and orchestras which set the rhythm of the year, summing up the sadness and suggestiveness of life in new tunes."""

2836,8,"""She wanted her life shaped now, immediately\u2014and the decision must be made by some force\u2014of love, of money, of unquestionable practicality\u2014that was close at hand."""
2837,8,"""That force took shape in the middle of spring with the arrival of Tom Buchanan."""
2838,8,"""There was a wholesome bulkiness about his person and his position, and Daisy was flattered."""

3339,9,"""I don\u2019t give a damn about you now, but it was a new experience for me, and I felt a little dizzy for a while.\u201d"""
3340,9,"""We shook hands."""
3341,9,"""\u201cOh, and do you remember\u201d\u2014she added\u2014\u201ca conversation we had once about driving a car?\u201d"""
3342,9,"""\u201cWhy\u2014not exactly.\u201d"""
3343,9,"""\u201cYou said a bad driver was only safe until she met another bad driver?"""
3344,9,"""Well, I met another bad driver, didn\u2019t I?"""
3345,9,"""I mean it was careless of me to make such a wrong guess."""
3346,9,"""I thought you were rather an honest, straightforward person."""
3347,9,"""I thought it was your secret pride.\u201d"""
3348,9,"""\u201cI\u2019m thirty,\u201d I said."""
3349,9,"""\u201cI\u2019m five years too old to lie to myself and call it honour.\u201d"""
3350,9,"""She didn\u2019t answer."""
3351,9,"""Angry, and half in love with her, and tremendously sorry, I turned away."""
3352,9,"""------------------------------------------------------------------------"""
3353,9,"""One afternoon late in October I saw Tom Buchanan."""
3354,9,"""He was walking ahead of me along Fifth Avenue in his alert, aggressive way, his hands out a little from his body as if to fight off interference, his head moving sharply here and there, adapting itself to his restless eyes."""
3355,9,"""Just as I slowed up to avoid overtaking him he stopped and began frowning into the windows of a jewellery store."""
3356,9,"""Suddenly he saw me and walked back, holding out his hand."""
3357,9,"""\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter, Nick?"""
3358,9,"""Do you object to shaking hands with me?\u201d"""
3359,9,"""\u201cYes."""
3360,9,"""You know what I think of you.\u201d"""
3361,9,"""\u201cYou\u2019re crazy, Nick,\u201d he said quickly."""
3362,9,"""\u201cCrazy as hell."""
3363,9,"""I don\u2019t know what\u2019s the matter with you.\u201d"""
3364,9,"""\u201cTom,\u201d I inquired, \u201cwhat did you say to Wilson that afternoon?\u201d"""
3365,9,"""He stared at me without a word, and I knew I had guessed right about those missing hours."""
3366,9,"""I started to turn away, but he took a step after me and grabbed my arm."""
3367,9,"""\u201cI told him the truth,\u201d he said."""
3368,9,"""\u201cHe came to the door while we were getting ready to leave, and when I sent down word that we weren\u2019t in he tried to force his way upstairs."""
3369,9,"""He was crazy enough to kill me if I hadn\u2019t told him who owned the car."""
3370,9,"""His hand was on a revolver in his pocket every minute he was in the house\u2014\u201d He broke off defiantly."""
3371,9,"""\u201cWhat if I did tell him?"""
3372,9,"""That fellow had it coming to him."""
3373,9,"""He threw dust into your eyes just like he did in Daisy\u2019s, but he was a tough one."""
3374,9,"""He ran over Myrtle like you\u2019d run over a dog and never even stopped his car.\u201d"""
3375,9,"""There was nothing I could say, except the one unutterable fact that it wasn\u2019t true."""
3376,9,"""\u201cAnd if you think I didn\u2019t have my share of suffering\u2014look here, when I went to give up that flat and saw that damn box of dog biscuits sitting there on the sideboard, I sat down and cried like a baby."""
3377,9,"""By God it was awful\u2014\u201d I couldn\u2019t forgive him or like him, but I saw that what he had done was, to him, entirely justified."""
3378,9,"""It was all very careless and confused."""
3379,9,"""They were careless people, Tom and Daisy\u2014they smashed up things and creatures and then retreated back into their money or their vast carelessness, or whatever it was that kept them together, and let other people clean up the mess they had made \u2026 I shook hands with him; it seemed silly not to, for I felt suddenly as though I were talking to a child."""
3380,9,"""Then he went into the jewellery store to buy a pearl necklace\u2014or perhaps only a pair of cuff buttons\u2014rid of my provincial squeamishness forever."""
3381,9,"""------------------------------------------------------------------------"""
3382,9,"""Gatsby\u2019s house was still empty when I left\u2014the grass on his lawn had grown as long as mine."""
3383,9,"""One of the taxi drivers in the village never took a fare past the entrance gate without stopping for a minute and pointing inside; perhaps it was he who drove Daisy and Gatsby over to East Egg the night of the accident, and perhaps he had made a story about it all his own."""
3384,9,"""I didn\u2019t want to hear it and I avoided him when I got off the train."""
3385,9,"""I spent my Saturday nights in New York because those gleaming, dazzling parties of his were with me so vividly that I could still hear the music and the laughter, faint and incessant, from his garden, and the cars going up and down his drive."""
3386,9,"""One night I did hear a material car there, and saw its lights stop at his front steps."""
3387,9,"""But I didn\u2019t investigate."""
3388,9,"""Probably it was some final guest who had been away at the ends of the earth and didn\u2019t know that the party was over."""
3389,9,"""On the last night, with my trunk packed and my car sold to the grocer, I went over and looked at that huge incoherent failure of a house once more."""
3390,9,"""On the white steps an obscene word, scrawled by some boy with a piece of brick, stood out clearly in the moonlight, and I erased it, drawing my shoe raspingly along the stone."""
3391,9,"""Then I wandered down to the beach and sprawled out on the sand."""
3392,9,"""Most of the big shore places were closed now and there were hardly any lights except the shadowy, moving glow of a ferryboat across the Sound."""
3393,9,"""And as the moon rose higher the inessential houses began to melt away until gradually I became aware of the old island here that flowered once for Dutch sailors\u2019 eyes\u2014a fresh, green breast of the new world."""
3394,9,"""Its vanished trees, the trees that had made way for Gatsby\u2019s house, had once pandered in whispers to the last and greatest of all human dreams; for a transitory enchanted moment man must have held his breath in the presence of this continent, compelled into an aesthetic contemplation he neither understood nor desired, face to face for the last time in history with something commensurate to his capacity for wonder."""
3395,9,"""And as I sat there brooding on the old, unknown world, I thought of Gatsby\u2019s wonder when he first picked out the green light at the end of Daisy\u2019s dock."""
3396,9,"""He had come a long way to this blue lawn, and his dream must have seemed so close that he could hardly fail to grasp it."""
3397,9,"""He did not know that it was already behind him, somewhere back in that vast obscurity beyond the city, where the dark fields of the republic rolled on under the night."""
3398,9,"""Gatsby believed in the green light, the orgastic future that year by year recedes before us."""
3399,9,"""It eluded us then, but that\u2019s no matter\u2014tomorrow we will run faster, stretch out our arms further \u2026"""
3400,9,"""And one fine morning\u2014 So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past."""
